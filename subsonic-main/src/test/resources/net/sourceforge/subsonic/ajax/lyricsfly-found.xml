        <tt>Beautiful Day</tt>
        <al>All that you can't leave behind</al>
        <tx>The heart is a bloom[br]
            Shoots up through the stony ground[br]
            There's no room[br]
            No space to rent in this town[br]
            [br]

            You're out of luck[br]
            And the reason that you had to care[br]
            The traffic is stuck[br]
            And you're not movin' anywhere[br]
            [br]

            You thought you'd found a friend[br]
            To take you out of this place[br]
            Someone you could lend a hand[br]
            In return for grace[br]
            [br]

            It's a beautiful day[br]
            Sky falls, you feel like[br]
            It's a beautiful day[br]
            Don't let it get away[br]
            [br]

            You're on the road[br]
            But you've got no destination[br]
            You're in the mud[br]
            In the maze of her imagination[br]
            [br]

            You love this town[br]
            Even if that doesn't ring true[br]
            You've been all over[br]
            And it's been all over you[br]
            [br]

            It's a beautiful day[br]
            Don't let it get away[br]
            It's a beautiful day[br]
            [br]

            Touch me[br]
            Take me to that other place[br]
            Teach me now[br]
            I know I'm not a hopeless case[br]
            [br]

            See the world in green and blue[br]
            See China right in front of you[br]
            See the canyons broken by cloud[br]
            See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out[br]
            [br]

            See the Bedouin fires at night[br]
            See the oil fields at first light[br]
            And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth[br]
            After the flood all the colors came out[br]
            (Day!)[br]
            [br]

            It was a beautiful day[br]
            Don't let it get away[br]
            Beautiful day[br]
            [br]

            Touch me[br]
            Take me to that other place[br]
            Reach me[br]
            I know I'm not a hopeless case[br]
            [br]

            What you don't have you don't need it now[br]
            What you don't know you can feel it somehow[br]
            What you don't have you don't need it now[br]
            Don't need it now[br]
            It was a beautiful day[br]
            [br]
            [br]
