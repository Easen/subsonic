                        This is useful, for example, if you have your music on multiple disks, or if you have one directory with
                        music, and another with movies. The index (on the left-hand side) can either show all
                        media folders (merged alphabetically), or you can select from a combo box which folder to display.</li>
                    <li>New: Assign ratings (one to five stars) and comments to individual albums.</li>

                    <li>New: You can configure a set of links to Internet TV and radio stations. These links become available in
                        the index on the left-hand side. Click on a link, and your player connects to the station.</li>
                    <li>New: Saved playlists are now available as Podcasts (available from the "More" page).</li>
                    <li>New: Improved player management. Support multiple players with the same IP address, and players with dynamic
                        IP addresses.  Display player type (e.g., WinAmp) and last-seen date.</li>
                    <li>New: Macedonian translation by Stefan Ivanovski.</li>
                    <li>New: Implemented support for non-Latin character encodings (for instance Japanese or Cyrillic).</li>
                    <li>New: Added option to load a previously saved playlist in the WAP interface.</li>
                    <li>New: "Album Info" now integrates with Google Music.</li>
                    <li>New: Avoid unnecessary reloading of the playlist window.</li>
